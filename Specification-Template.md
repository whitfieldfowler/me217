## Executive Summary ##
This is a one-pager summarizing the info in the rest of the document.

## Problem Description ##
This is a descriptions of the perceived issues and challenges: a description of the current state of things as experienced by people.

## Business and Organization Context ##
This section will describe what organization is the primary agent for this project. A complete section will include the mission of the organization, the current business outlook, and how this project fits in with the organization's near-term goals and priorities.

## Soloution Scope ##
This section will describe the boundaries and constraints for the project. What it may include, what is off limits, what resources have been or will be invested in the project, and any hard limits on time, money, materials, or complexity.

## Stakeholders and Value Exchanges ##
This section will clearly identify each of the stakeholders to be considered in this project. When possible, an individual person should be identified to represent each of the stakeholders. A complete analysis will empathize with each stakeholder to identify their experiences, concerns, and goals. The CVCA will be a critical piece of analysis for understanding value exhanges: who is paying who, what products/services/experiences are being provided, who is talking to who, and what type of information is flowing.

## Voices of the Customer and Engineering Metrics ##
This section will consist of a consolidated and focussed list of what the key customers are willing to pay for. Each should have a short description for the feature, functionality, or experience, described in words the *customers* themselves use. For each Voice of the Customer, there must be at least one primary means of quantifiably measuring the delivery of that feature, function, or experience.

## Quality Function Deployment, House 1 ##
This section will show the mapping of Voices of the Customer to Engineering Metrics using the 9, 3, 1, 0 method taught in the class. The outputs will be a valuation of the engineering metrics.

## Existing Solution Elements ##
The existing solution (at least one) will be described in terms of its elements. These will be the products, services, and systems delivering the current experiences for the customers. Each solution element must have an associated cost to deliver.

## Quality Function Deployment, House 2 ##
This section will show the mapping of the Engineering Metrics to the *current* Solution Elements. The output will be the valuations of each of the solution elements: a *worth* score for each, which has been derived from the original Voices of the Customer.

## Cost Worth Analysis ##
This section will show a graph of the Worth of each existing solution element to the cost to deliver that solution element. This will often show which solution elements are expensive relative to the value they are delivering to the customers.

## Function to Structure Mapping ##
This section will show the current solution elements mapped out using a tree diagram. For physical components, this will be components, sub-assemblies, and high-level product. This section will also consider all the detailed functions accomplished by the components of the system. The functions will be mapped out in a tree diagram where the sub-functions stem from higher-level funcitons, which should answer the question why at each level of the function tree. This section will conclude by comparing the function tree to the structure tree to begin to anser some basic questions. Are there functions that might be better served by different structural solutions? Are there key functions missing that would be valued by customers. Are there structures and components no longer serving much purpose?

## Key Opportunity ##
This section will summarize the key opportunity to create something new in order to address valuable opportunities.

## Concept Generation and Morphological Analysis ##
This section will outline the proposed concepts established through structured brainstorming.

## Concept Selection and Pugh Analysis ##
This section will summarize the concept selected using the Pugh Concept Selection Method.

## Solution Description ##
This section will present a design for the concept selected.

## Prototype Building Plan ##
This section will outline a timeline describing the money, time, and materials needed to build a prototype of the concept. It will identify the single most important question to answer with this prototype, and why that is the right question to answer.

## Prototype Testing Plan ##
This seciton will outline how the prototype will be tested, and what evidence will be needed in order to answer the key protoyping question.

## Prototype Building and Testing Documentation ##
Results from the tests.

## Next Steps ##
This section will describe the possible next steps for the project, and will propose which one makes the most sense at the moment, together with the basis for that proposal. If there is a next step for the project, what resources will be needed?
